   <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data through simple commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. SQL is essential for querying large amounts of data efficiently and is widely used in web applications, data analysis, and enterprise software. It supports data integrity, security, and transaction control, making it powerful for handling structured data.</p>
