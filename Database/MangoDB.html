    <h1>MongoDB</h1>
    <p>MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents instead of traditional tables. It allows for dynamic schemas, making it ideal for handling unstructured or semi-structured data. MongoDB is scalable, fast, and commonly used in modern web applications due to its ability to handle large volumes of data across distributed systems. It supports powerful querying, indexing, and real-time analytics, making it a popular choice for developers.</p>
