    <h2>Frameworks</h2>
    <p>A framework is a pre-built collection of tools, libraries, and best practices that helps developers build software more efficiently. It provides a structured foundation and reusable code, so programmers donâ€™t have to start from scratch. Frameworks are used in web, mobile, and desktop development to speed up the process, ensure consistency, and improve code quality. Popular examples include React and Angular for web development, and Django for Python-based applications.</p>
