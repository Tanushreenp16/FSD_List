    <h2>Java</h2>
    <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language designed to be platform-independent, meaning code can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It's widely used for building web applications, mobile apps (especially Android), desktop software, and enterprise systems. Java is known for its reliability, security, and scalability, making it a core technology in many large-scale applications.</p>
