    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It runs directly in the browser, allowing developers to build features like animations, form validations, and responsive user interfaces. JavaScript works alongside HTML and CSS to enhance the user experience by enabling real-time updates without needing to reload the page. Itâ€™s also widely used on the server side through platforms like Node.js, making it a powerful tool for full-stack web development. With its rich ecosystem and ease of learning, JavaScript remains one of the most popular programming languages in the world.</p>
