    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages. It controls how HTML elements appear on screen, paper, or other media. With CSS, you can set colors, fonts, margins, borders, spacing, positioning, and even create animations and transitions. It allows for responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes using media queries. CSS works in layersâ€”rules can cascade and be overridden, giving developers flexibility and control. Combined with HTML and JavaScript, CSS forms the foundation of modern web development. It helps maintain consistency across multiple pages and enhances user experience through visual design. CSS allows developers to separate content from design, making code cleaner and easier to maintain. It supports responsive design, ensuring websites look good on all screen sizes. </p>
